# Popcorn Detection
Repository documenting my ongoing project of making a piece of software (+ hardware?) which can detect when my popcorn are done popping.

# Version 1
Version one of the code, which is referenced in [this](https://anders-lauridsen.dk/popcorn_detection) blog post, has been deleted because I did some not smart things with the repository.
